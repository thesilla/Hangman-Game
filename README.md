# Hangman-Game
Project for school. This was already submitted....We were only required to print interface to console but looking to clear screen after every turn and later create actual GUI just for my own learning purposes.
I'm but a loley noob trying to work hard and gain confidence in this sector....would like to be a business systems programmer someday.
